# About Me

Hello! Iâ€™m **Abrianna S**, a passionate and dedicated **law student** with academic training and hands-on experience across multiple branches of law.  

I specialize in **contracts, constitutional law, company law, and banking law**, and I have interned with notable law firms and a sitting High Court judge. My internships exposed me to **drafting, research, client consultations, and real-world litigation practices**, strengthening both my analytical and practical legal skills.  

Outside academics, I actively contribute to research and have published papers on **cybersecurity risks in banking, mediation, and child marriage laws**. These publications reflect my curiosity in blending contemporary issues with traditional legal frameworks.  

Beyond the classroom, I am actively involved in university clubs and community initiatives, which have shaped my skills in **leadership, communication, and teamwork**.  

My long-term aspiration is to meaningfully contribute to the legal profession by bridging legal knowledge with practical solutions for society.
